- 👋 Hi, I’m Sherzodbek and I am 17. So, now you are reading the introduction of an upcoming front-end junior developer. I know HTML, CSS, SCSS and Javascript. I can use bootstrap and materialize css libraries, too. On top of this, as you can see I am quite good at English language, because I am studying English to get IELTS certificate!
- 👀 I’m interested in coding, english language, astronomy and geography. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning React JS - one of the most prevalent libraries of Javascript.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on building useful and awesome websites.
